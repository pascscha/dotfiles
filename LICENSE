2. This software was written with assistance from AI, but the author has
   reviewed and understands what it does. You should too. If it breaks your
   system, that's on you. The author accepts zero responsibility for any
   consequences of running it.

3. By using this software, you acknowledge that you have actually read the code
   before blindly piping it into bash. If you didn't, see condition #2.

4. No, seriously. Read the code first.

5. If this software somehow makes you rich, cool. The author accepts tips in
   the form of Mate (the drink, not the friend).

TL;DR: Do whatever you want with it, but don't blame me when it explodes.
